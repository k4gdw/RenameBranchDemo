Rename Branch In Git (Demo)
===========================

What is it?
-----------

It's a test repository that I can use to test and/or demo my shell script
that, renames a git branch. Play with it all you want. That's what I'll be 
doing. :) Just be courteous and don't mess with the master branch.

Why?
----

Why write a script for something so simple as renaming a branch? I believe
very strongly in automation, especially when a stupid manual mistake can
end up deleting data that is impossible, or just a PITA to recover. Learn
the process, then script it, if at all possible. Scripting a process
eliminates opportunity for human error.

How to help?
------------

If you know of a better way to accomplish this task, fork the project,
create a topic branch, code it up, and send me a pull request.
