RenameBranchDemo
================

This is a test repository that I can use to test and/or demo my shell script
that, renames a git branch.

Play with it all you want. That's what I'll be doing. :) Just be courteous and
don't mess with the master branch.

Why write a script for something so simple as renaming a branch? I believe
very strongly in automation, especially when a stupid manual mistake can end up
deleting data that is impossible, or just a PITA to recover. Learn the process,
then script it if at all possible.
